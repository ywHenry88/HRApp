### Key Objectives
- Simplify leave request submission for employees
- Streamline approval workflow for administrators
- Provide real-time visibility into leave balances
- Support bilingual interface (English/Traditional Chinese)
- Deploy on local Windows network for data privacy
- Easy maintenance and minimal infrastructure requirements

  - EN: `https://www.1823.gov.hk/common/ical/en.json`
  - ÁπÅ: `https://www.1823.gov.hk/common/ical/tc.json`
- UI prototype updates:

- Database design:
  - `tb_Holidays` extended with `SourceUID`, `SourceProvider`, `LastSyncedAt`
  - New TVP `dbo.HolidayImportType` for bulk import
  - New stored procedure `sp_UpsertHolidays_TVP` to merge incoming holidays by date

---

## üÜï Version 2.0 New Features

### Version 2.0.3 Updates (October 21, 2025)
Business rules alignment and admin constraints (RULES.md is authoritative):

1) AnnualTotal calculation and field design
- AnnualDays per year is based on admin input at hire year, pro-rated for join date in first year: n * (days_remaining_in_year / 365)
- Yearly increment: starting 2024, +1 day per year until capped at m (e.g., 16.5)
- BalanceFromLastYear carry forward is added
- CompensatoryLeave allocated by admin (decimal allowed) is added
- Example: 2024 = 7.5+1=8.5; 2025 = 7.5+2=9.5; AnnualTotal = AnnualDays + BalanceFromLastYear + CompensatoryLeave

2) Paid Sick Leave rule
- Each staff receives SickLeavePaid (e.g., 4.5 days) per year (field: tb_Users.SickLeavePaid)
- Sick days beyond SickLeavePaid are deducted from AnnualTotal (count as annual leave)

3) Application unit
- Employee leave applications must be whole days
- Admin may allocate compensatory leave with decimals (e.g., 2.5)

4) Data modeling guidelines
- Store AnnualDays per year in a historical table to avoid recalculation iteration; do not mutate prior years
- Suggested tables/fields:
  - tb_LeaveYearAllocations(UserID, Year, AnnualDays, SickLeavePaid)
  - tb_LeaveBalances(UserID, Year, BalanceFromLastYear, CompensatoryLeave, AnnualTotalCached)
  - AnnualTotalCached is updated by stored procedure when allocations/compensatory change

5) Admin approval scope
- Admin can only approve/reject requests and add comments; cannot change leave days or requested dates in approval UI
- Partial approval is represented as an outcome (approved subset of requested dates) via `tb_LeaveRequestDates`, not by selecting dates in UI

6) New Admin Module: Compensatory Leave
- Admin page to add/delete compensatory leave records per user with decimal days
- Records contribute to AnnualTotal

UI updates:
- Added `UI/pages/admin/compensatory-leave.html`
- Updated sidebars to include Compensatory Leave
- Simplified `admin/approve-leaves.html` actions to approve/reject only
