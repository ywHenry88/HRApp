# Dashboard Improvements - Version 2.4.1

## Overview
This document details the improvements made to the Employee Dashboard based on user feedback regarding readability, consistency, and organization. Updated to v2.4.1 with additional refinements.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Name Visibility Issue
**Problem:** Employee name was almost invisible due to light text on gradient background.

**Solution:** 
- Changed from gradient background to white card with left border accent
- Used dark gray text (`text-gray-800`) for employee name
- Added accent color (`text-[#00AFB9]`) for the name itself
- Changed info cards to light gray backgrounds with borders

**Before:**
```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-[#00AFB9] to-[#4BCBD6] text-white">
    <h2><span id="employeeName">Wong Pak Kun</span></h2>
</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-[#00AFB9]">
    <h2 class="text-gray-800">
        Welcome, <span id="employeeName" class="text-[#00AFB9]">Wong Pak Kun (黃柏根)</span>
    </h2>
</div>
```

---

### 2. ✅ Inconsistent Data Display
**Problem:** Annual Leave showed "days applied" while Sick Leave showed "days remaining" - confusing for users.

**Solution:** 
- Standardized both leave types to show **Applied / Total** in the subtitle
- Show large **Remaining** number prominently on the right side
- Consistent format: "Applied: X / Y days" with big remaining number

**Visual Structure:**
```
[Icon] Leave Type              [Big Number]
       Applied: X / Y days     Remaining
```

---

### 3. ✅ Leave Summary Box Style
**Problem:** Leave Summary cards didn't match the professional style of Pending Requests box.

**Solution:**
- Applied left border accent style to both Annual and Sick leave cards
- Used individual white cards with shadows and rounded corners
- Added consistent spacing and layout
- **v2.4.1:** Changed to blue borders for both leave cards (`border-blue-500`) to visually group them
- Icons maintain their distinctive colors (teal for annual, red for sick)
- Pending Requests: `border-l-4 border-yellow-400` (yellow) to stand out

---

### 4. ✅ Font Size Adjustments
**Problem:** Some text was too large and cluttered the view.

**Solution:**
- Applied info note: Reduced to `text-[9px]` from `text-[10px]`
- **v2.4.1:** Policy box text: Reduced to `text-[8px]` from `text-[9px]`
- Label text: Reduced to `text-[9px]` for "Remaining" labels
- Maintained readability while reducing visual noise

---

### 5. ✅ Language Translation Issues
**Problem:** Text like "Pending Requests" remained in English when switched to Chinese.

**Solution:**
- Added complete `data-i18n` attributes to all dynamic text
- Updated `app.js` with missing translations:
  - `leave.applied`: "Applied" / "已使用"
  - `leave.remaining`: "Remaining" / "剩餘"
  - `leave.appliedNote`: "5 days applied in current period" / "當前服務期間已使用5天"
  - `dashboard.pendingRequests`: "Pending Requests" / "待處理請求"
  - `dashboard.awaitingApproval`: "Awaiting approval" / "等待批准"
  - `dashboard.viewAll`: "View all" / "查看全部"

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div>Pending Requests</div>

<!-- After -->
<div data-i18n="dashboard.pendingRequests">Pending Requests</div>
```

---

### 6. ✅ Removed Quick Actions
**Problem:** "Request Leave" and "View History" buttons were duplicates of the bottom navigation.

**Solution:**
- Removed the entire Quick Actions section
- Users can access these features via the persistent bottom navigation bar
- Reduces clutter and redundancy
- Improves focus on important information

---

### 7. ✅ General Organization Improvements

**Layout Structure (Top to Bottom):**
1. **Header** - Clean, with date in top bar
2. **Welcome Section** - White card with employee info
3. **Annual Leave Card** - Blue left border (v2.4.1)
4. **Sick Leave Card** - Blue left border (v2.4.1)
5. **Policy Info** - No border, smaller font (v2.4.1)
6. **Pending Requests** - Yellow left border
7. **Team Schedule** - Calendar view

**Visual Consistency:**
- All cards use white backgrounds with shadows
- Left border accent colors indicate content type
- Consistent padding: `p-4` for cards
- Consistent spacing: `mb-3` or `mb-4` between sections
- Icon circles: `w-10 h-10` rounded-full with distinctive colors
- Font hierarchy maintained throughout

---

## Additional Refinements (v2.4.1)

### 1. **Show Calculation for Estimate**
**Requested:** Display calculation clearly for transparency

**Solution:**
- Changed "18.8 days" to "**11 + 7.8 = 18.8 days**"
- Shows exactly how the estimate is calculated
- Helps users understand the prorated calculation
- Format: `Granted days + Prorated days = Total estimate`

**Code:**
```html
<div class="font-bold text-[#00AFB9]">11 + 7.8 = 18.8 days</div>
```

---

### 2. **Blue Borders for Leave Cards**
**Requested:** Add blue line (border) to Annual and Sick leave boxes

**Solution:**
- Changed both cards from individual colors to unified **blue borders** (`border-blue-500`)
- This visually groups them together as "leave information"
- Icons keep their distinctive colors:
  - Annual Leave: Teal circular background (`bg-[#00AFB9]`)
  - Sick Leave: Red circular background (`bg-[#FF6B6B]`)
- Yellow border remains for Pending Requests to make it stand out

**Before:**
- Annual: `border-l-4 border-[#00AFB9]` (teal)
- Sick: `border-l-4 border-[#FF6B6B]` (red)

**After:**
- Annual: `border-l-4 border-blue-500` (blue)
- Sick: `border-l-4 border-blue-500` (blue)

---

### 3. **Policy Box Simplified**
**Requested:** Remove blue line from policy box, make font smaller

**Solution:**
- Removed left border: `border-l-4 border-blue-400` → removed
- Reduced font size: `text-[9px]` → `text-[8px]`
- Still uses light blue background (`bg-blue-50`) for visual distinction
- Information remains accessible but less prominent
- Cleaner, more compact appearance

**Before:**
```html
<div class="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-blue-400">
    <div class="text-[9px]">...</div>
</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded-xl">
    <div class="text-[8px]">...</div>
</div>
```

---

### 4. **Icon Styling Consistency**
**Requested:** Add icons before leave boxes like Pending Requests

**Confirmed:** Icons already present and styled consistently:
- **Annual Leave:** 
  - `<i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i>` in teal circle
  - Calendar icon represents scheduled leave
- **Sick Leave:** 
  - `<i class="fas fa-procedures"></i>` in red circle
  - Medical icon represents sick leave
- **Pending Requests:** 
  - `<i class="fas fa-clock"></i>` in yellow circle
  - Clock icon represents waiting status

All use the same structure:
```html
<div class="w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-[color] flex items-center justify-center">
    <i class="fas fa-[icon] text-white text-sm"></i>
</div>
```
